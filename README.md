# Class Management System(Registrations System)

This Project is totally based on Core Java programming. This is a Terminal based Project. When i was pursuing my java certification Course from C-tel Solutions at that time i had developed this Project just for practice.
This project content many different concepts and Predefine Methods of java. To store all the data i have use file Handling Concept.
    
Core Java is Totally perfect to start with projects in java, After developement of project We can continue with Advance concepts and Advance level of Java.

## Lessons Learned

What did I learn while building this project? What challenges did I face and how did I overcome that challenges?

While developing this project i have learn many concepts and techniques to write code. Concepts are Object Oriented Programming(OOP), File Handling, Loops, If-Else conditional Statements, etc.

The major challenge which i had faced was with File Handling. I have used File Handling with this Project, so to store, fetch, update and delete the data from the files are quite hard. I exprienced this harder.
